```diff
This is the full package of opencv
-pip install opencv-contrib-python   
This is the main packages of Opencv in here opencv-contribe python is the best practise
-pip install opencv-python 
This library is used to data visualization purpose in python
-pip install matplotlib

Import the opencv package as cv2 naming
-import cv2
Import Numpy packages which giving the all numerical logics in python 
-import numpy as np
import the matplotlib which is data visualization library as plt
-import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

This is used to check the opencv version, I checked this because there are some error occurred situation as best practise
-print(cv2.__version__)

This use to open the image
-img = cv2.imread('C:\\Users\\Hasitha\\Desktop\\kanikaSir\\IM\\preset-shapes.jpg')
-plt.imshow(img)

This is the way how to convert RGB image to Gray Color
Uses of the greyscale images
 • To reduce the processing complexity
 • Getting simplified associated Metrix
 • Cutting off the high resolution color distribution
 • Reduce complexity and speed up the processing
-gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
-plt.imshow(gray)

This method applying for the image, when the best practice of the machine learning model training because from this method can be improved the smoothiness of the image, like Noice reduction, Details Simplification(for the image blurring is affect to limit the details of the image so this is the preferred way of image preprocessing and image cleaning), and also this is help to edge smoothing concept, and another reason of this blur method it helps to image blending.
-blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray,(5,5),1)
-plt.imshow(blurred)

This canny edge concept is use to detect wide range of edges in the images. When adding gaussian blur method with this canny edge concept can be get the best result. It helps to noice reduction and gradient calculations (this canny edge concept cause to calculate the gradient of an image to find the edges intensity and direction)
-edges = cv2.Canny(blurred,50,150)
-plt.imshow(edges)

Threshold concept is used to identify foreground(objects or interest) getting separately from background based on pixel intensity values. In here the process is this convert the grayscale image to binary image like binary array either set to 0(black) to 255(white) based on specific threshold values.
-_, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
-plt.imshow(thresh)

This contour concept is used in the open-cv for detecting objects and drawing bounding boxes and also there are several uses from this contour like : shape analysis, Object Detection, Object Recognition, Image Segmentation, and the Boundary representation of the desired object of user. 
-contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

This is process for drawing contours for object highlighting for shape analysis also, 
 • -1: This indicates that all contours should be drawn. If you specify an index, only the contour at that index will be drawn.
 • (0, 255, 0) : The color of the contours, which in this case is green (in BGR format).
 • 2: The thickness of the contour lines.
-cv2.drawContours(img, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0),2)

    Apply Gausian blur to reduce noice and help contours detections

    Use canny edge detection to find the edges in the image

     find the contours in the image

        If the polygon has 3 vertices, it's a triangluar
-        if len(approx) == 3:
             Draw the bounding box around the trianglar (in red)
-            x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
-            cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 0, 255), 2)
